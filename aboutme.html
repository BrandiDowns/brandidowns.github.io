	<h1>Hi!</h1>
	
	<p>I'm Brandi, an electrical engineering student, mom, veteran of the U.S. Coast Guard, and lifelong learner. I have familiarity with C++, Java, assembly language, and hardware design. My present pursuits are radar, antennas, MATLAB, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I'm currently working with a research group to integrate a radar, GPS, and Raspberry Pi on a UAV platform and get certified by the FAA to fly drones commercially. Thanks for checking out my site!</p>
